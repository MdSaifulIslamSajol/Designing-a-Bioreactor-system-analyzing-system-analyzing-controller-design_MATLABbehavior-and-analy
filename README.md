## Designing-and-analyzing-a-Bioreactor-system-and-observe-system-behavior-using-MATLAB
The following tasks are performed in a biomedical system:

1.	Built a model of the system in Matlab/Simulink.
2.	Linearize the system model in a suitable operation point.
3.	Analyze the system behavior, i.e. stability, controllability, observability as necessary.
4.	Design a state space controller based on either the linear quadratic or pole placement approach. In addition, design a state observer.
5.	Analyse the controller design and record the obtained results as necessary.
